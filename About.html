    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      Manchester, city and metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester urban county,
      northwestern England. Most of the city, including the historic core, is in the historic county of Lancashire,
      but
      it includes an area south of the River Mersey in the historic county of Cheshire.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Manchester is the nucleus of the
      largest metropolitan area in the north of England, and it remains an important regional city, but it has lost
      the
      extraordinary vitality and unique influence that put it at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Manchester was an urban prototype: in many respects it could claim to be the first of the new generation of
      huge
      industrial cities created in the Western world during the past 250 years. In 1717 it was merely a market town of
      10,000 people, but by 1851 its textile (chiefly cotton) industries had so prospered that it had become a
      manufacturing and commercial city of more than 300,000 inhabitants, already spilling out its suburbs and
      absorbing
      its industrial satellites

    <p>
      Manchester was one of the centres of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The great majority of
      cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time
      the
      most productive centre of cotton processing
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Manchester became known as the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods and was dubbed
      "Cottonopolis"
      and "Warehouse City" during the Victorian era. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term
      "manchester" is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc. The industrial revolution
      brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester's population.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
      Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the
      city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned
      urbanisation brought on by the Industrial Revolution.It developed a wide range of industries, so that
      by 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world." Engineering
      firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture.

    <p>
      Manchester occupies a featureless plain made up of river gravels and the glacially transported debris known as
      drift. It lies at a height of 133 feet (40 metres) above sea level, enclosed by the slopes of the Pennine range on
      the east and the upland spur of Rossendale on the north. Much of the plain is underlain by coal measures; mining
      was once widespread but had ceased by the end of the 20th century
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Within this physical unit, known as the Manchester embayment, the cityâ€™s metropolitan area evolved. Manchester,
      the central city, is situated on the east bank of the River Irwell and has an elongated north-south extent, the
      result of late 19th- and early 20th-century territorial expansion. In 1930 the city extended its boundaries far to
      the south beyond the River Mersey, to annex 9 square miles (23 square km) of the northern portion of the former
      administrative county of Cheshire.

      The City of Manchester is governed by the Manchester City Council. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority, with
      a directly elected mayor, has responsibilities for economic strategy and transport, amongst other areas, on a
      Greater Manchester-wide basis. Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception
      in 1995.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The Board of Mayor and Aldermen is the legislative body of the City of Manchester, and members are elected every
      two years by the residents of Manchester. The Board is made up of two at-large aldermen who represent the entire
      city, and twelve aldermen who represent the wards of the city where they reside.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The Board of Mayor and Aldermen serves as a link between Manchester residents and local government, helping to
      connect people to services, resources and city departments. (Above image is Andy Burnham, Mayor)
