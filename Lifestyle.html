    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>
    <p>
      Manchester is home to two of the biggest names in sport: Manchester United and Manchester City football clubs.
      Manchester United's ground, Old Trafford, is the largest club ground in Britain. While Manchester City are based
      on the other side of the city at the Etihad Stadium, originally built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.
      National and international cricket can be enjoyed at Lancashire's Old Trafford Ground, and rugby union and rugby
      league teams play at nearby Sale, Salford, Wigan and Warrington.

    <h2>Shopping In Manchester</h2>

    Manchester is known as the 'shopping capital of the North'. You'll find everything from department stores and high
    street chains, to vintage fairs and designer boutiques.

    The trendy Northern Quarter is the creative hub of Manchester's shopping scene and offers a unique experience with
    its
    mix of bars, caf√©s and eclectic one-off shops.

    If you prefer having all the best shops in one place, the out-of-town Trafford Centre is for you. More than 35
    million
    visitors come to enjoy 250 stores and 35 restaurants each year.

    There's also a number of additional shopping centres located more centrally, including the Manchester Arndale and
    the
    Triangle Shopping Centre - an impressive boutique-style mall, located within the city's former corn exchange.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Tourist Attraction Sites</h1>
    <h2>1. Castlefield</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/castlefield.jpg" alt="castlefield in manchester"> <br>
      Designated an Urban Heritage Park, Castlefield is an excellent place to begin exploring Manchester. A walk among
      the
      lovingly restored Victorian houses along the old canals or through the reconstructed Roman Fort is time well
      spent.
      <br>
      Be sure to explore the Bridgewater Canal, constructed in 1761 to transport coal from the mines at Worsley to
      Manchester. The many old warehouses that line the canal have been restored and turned into offices, shops, hotels,
      and restaurants. A trip on one of the Bridgewater tour boats is highly recommended.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>2. Science and Industry Museum</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/science museum.jpg" alt="science museum in manchester"> <br>
      The Science and Industry Museum is on the site of the world's oldest railroad station. Its 12 galleries include
      the
      Power Hall, with water and steam-driven machines from the golden age of the textile industry, as well as vintage
      made-in-Manchester cars, including a rare 1904 Rolls Royce.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>3. Manchester Cathedral</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/manchester-cathedral.jpg" alt="cethedral in manchester"><br>
      Perched on the banks of the River Irwell, Manchester Cathedral - officially the Cathedral and Collegiate Church of
      St. Mary, St. Denys, and St. George - dates mostly from 1422 to 1506 and was raised to cathedral status in 1847.
      Particularly attractive are its chapels on both sides of the nave and choir.
      <br>
      It was built between 1486 and 1508 with further additions and alterations in almost every subsequent century. Of
      particular note are the choir stalls, with some of the most richly decorated misericords in the country.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>4. National Football Museum</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/england-manchester-national-football-museum.jpg" alt="football museum"><br>
      First stop should be the National Football Museum. This football shrine features fascinating memorabilia related
      to
      the sport, including such gems as the very first rulebook, as well as historic trophies and clothing.
      <br>
      It's also worth paying a visit to one (or both) of the Manchester teams' home stadiums. Manchester City's Etihad
      Stadium offers a variety of fun tour options, including behind-the-scenes and deluxe dinner tours. Old Trafford -
      home to Manchester United - offers guided tours that allow access to private boxes and the chance to tread the
      field
      itself.
